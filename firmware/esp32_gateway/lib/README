# Lib Directory – Custom Libraries

This folder is reserved for **project-specific libraries** that extend or modularize functionality of the ESP32 Gateway firmware.

Each library should have its own subfolder structure:

lib/
├── WiFiManager/
│    └── src/
│         ├── WiFiManager.cpp
│         └── WiFiManager.h
└── README

## Possible future use
- Custom UART communication library between Arduino UNO and ESP32.
- Helper module for parsing sensor data and building ThingSpeak payloads.
- MQTT client module (if protocol is added in later iterations).

Currently, no custom libraries are implemented.
