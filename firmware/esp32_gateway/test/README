# Test Directory – PlatformIO Unit Tests

This folder contains **unit or integration tests** for validating the ESP32 Gateway firmware.

## Purpose
To verify that individual modules (e.g., Wi-Fi connection, HTTP upload, UART communication) work correctly before full system integration.

## Planned Tests
- **Wi-Fi connectivity test** → Ensures connection to local network.
- **ThingSpeak upload test** → Verifies successful HTTP 200 responses.
- **UART parsing test** → Validates data integrity from Arduino UNO.

Tests can be executed using the PlatformIO Test Runner:
```bash
pio test -e mhetesp32devkit
