# Include Directory – Header Files

This folder contains the **header files (`.h`)** used across the ESP32 Gateway firmware.

These files define constants, configuration parameters, and function declarations shared between source files.

## Contents
- **`secrets.h`** → Stores private credentials such as Wi-Fi SSID, password, and ThingSpeak API key (excluded from GitHub via `.gitignore`).
- **`config.h`** *(optional)* → Global configuration (UART baud rate, HTTP interval, etc.) if needed.

## Purpose
Centralize all definitions and declarations to ensure modular and maintainable code.
