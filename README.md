# üå± Smart Irrigation System ‚Äì IoT + Edge AI (TinyML)

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a **Smart Irrigation System** that leverages **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Edge Artificial Intelligence (TinyML)** technologies to automate and optimize the watering process in diverse environments ‚Äî from small private gardens to large agricultural fields.  

The system continuously monitors environmental and soil conditions through low-cost sensors and performs on-device inference using **TinyML models** deployed on an **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**.  
Based on the prediction, it controls the irrigation mechanism autonomously while transmitting sensor data to the cloud via an **ESP32 Gateway** for visualization and analysis on **ThingSpeak Cloud**.  

By combining **local decision-making (Edge AI)** and **cloud-based analytics**, this architecture enables efficient, scalable, and sustainable water management with minimal human intervention.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation systems‚Äîwhether in large agricultural fields or small private gardens‚Äîoften rely on manual scheduling or fixed-timer control, leading to inefficient water use and suboptimal plant growth.  
Such approaches fail to adapt to real-time environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity, which are critical factors for plant health and sustainable water management.

This project proposes the design and implementation of a **Smart Irrigation System** based on **IoT and Edge Artificial Intelligence (TinyML)**.  
The system monitors environmental variables and autonomously decides the optimal watering action using local inference, without continuous cloud dependence.  
By integrating low-cost sensors, **Edge AI inference** on **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**, and **cloud-based analytics** through **ThingSpeak**, the system provides a scalable solution applicable to both **small-scale home gardens** and **large agricultural environments**, ensuring **water efficiency and healthy plant growth**.
