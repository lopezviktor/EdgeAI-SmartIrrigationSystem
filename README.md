# üå± Smart Irrigation System ‚Äì IoT + Edge AI (TinyML)

## 1. Project Overview

In regions affected by water scarcity, traditional irrigation systems often rely on fixed schedules or manual control, leading to significant water waste.  
This project proposes a **low-cost, intelligent irrigation solution** that combines **IoT sensing**, **Edge AI inference**, and **cloud-based monitoring** to achieve efficient and autonomous water management.

The system integrates **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**, **ESP32 Gateway**, and **ThingSpeak Cloud** to make real-time, data-driven irrigation decisions directly at the edge.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop a **reliable IoT-based irrigation system** capable of autonomous operation.  
- Implement **Edge AI (TinyML)** to perform on-device inference (‚Äúwater‚Äù / ‚Äúno water‚Äù) without cloud dependency.  
- Enable **real-time data transmission and visualization** through **ThingSpeak Cloud**.  
- Demonstrate the benefits of combining **IoT, Edge AI, and Cloud** for sustainable resource management.

1. Environmental sensors collect **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **light intensity** data.  
2. The **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** preprocesses and performs **TinyML inference**, classifying the state as ‚Äúwater‚Äù or ‚Äúno water.‚Äù  
3. The decision and raw sensor readings are transmitted via **UART (M2M)** to the **ESP32 gateway**.  
4. The **ESP32** sends the data to **ThingSpeak Cloud** using HTTPS.  
5. ThingSpeak visualizes the data and AI predictions in real time through its dashboard interface.  
6. Optional: Additional cloud analytics and efficiency metrics can be implemented.
